Else, switch to branch "master", do "git pull origin master".

3. cd into "vacation_planner_server" directory.

4. For linux/mac run "./activator". For windows run "activator.bat".

5. For the first time it will take around 15 minutes to download all dependencies. After which you will see "[vacation_planner] $"

6. Type "run" in the terminal. After the server has started, it will show you the message "Server Started" in the terminal and will tell you the Port Number on which it is listening for HTTP Requests.
